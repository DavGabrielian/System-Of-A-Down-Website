      <p>
        System of a Down is an Armenian-American heavy metal band formed in
        Glendale, California in 1994. The band currently consists of founding
        members Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards), Daron Malakian (vocals,
        guitar) and Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals) as well as John
        Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy Khachaturian in
        1997.[1] The band achieved commercial success with the release of five
        studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on the US Billboard
        200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards and
        their song "B.Y.O.B." won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance
        in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010; since
        then, they have performed live occasionally despite having not released
        any new material since the Mezmerize and Hypnotize albums in 2005.
        System of a Down has sold over 40 million records worldwide, while two
        of their singles "Aerials" and "Hypnotize" reached number one on
        Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.

        In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, System of a
        Down. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles "Sugar" and
        "Spiders" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs
        <img class="img" src="img/soad-about.jpeg" />
        were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band
        toured extensively, opening for Slayer and Metallica before making their
        way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with
        Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core Tour with Puya,
        Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support. In November 1998,
        System of a Down appeared on South Park's Chef Aid album, providing the
        music for the song "Will They Die 4 You?" Near the end of the song
        Tankian can be heard saying, "Why must we kill our own kind?", a line
        that would later be used in the song "Boom!" Although System of a Down
        is credited on the album, South Park character Chef does not introduce
        them as he does every other artist featured on the record.[7] System of
        a Down's former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with
        the band at a show at The Troubadour in 1999, filling in on vocals for
        an ill Tankian.[3] In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the
        Black Sabbath song "Snowblind" to the Black Sabbath tribute album
        Nativity in Black 2.[8]

        On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their
        second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a "thank you" to fans.
        The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to
        accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans
        showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance
        was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage.
        No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans
        waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner
        hanging at the back of the stage that read "System of a Down" was
        removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the
        band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began
        to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over
        portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests
        were made. The band's manager, David "Beno" Benveniste, later said that
        the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to
        perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert
        regarding the cancellation. System of a Down's scheduled in-store
        performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.[9][10]
        The group's big break arrived when their second album, Toxicity, debuted
        at No. 1 on the American and Canadian charts, despite the events of
        9/11. The album has eventually achieved 3x multi-platinum certification
        in the United States[11] It was still on top in America during the week
        of the 9/11 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks
        added to the controversy surrounding the album's hit single "Chop Suey!"
        The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive
        lyrics according to the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum at the time such
        as "(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide." Regardless,
        the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album's second single,
        "Toxicity". Even with the controversy surrounding "Chop Suey!" (which
        earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant
        airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with
        "Toxicity" and "Aerials". In May 2006, VH1 listed "Toxicity" in the
        number 14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs. In 2001, the band went on
        tour with Slipknot throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a
        performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed,
        ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards
        backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received
        medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the
        security company.[12] Despite the incident, the tour was a success and
        System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour
        together with Rammstein in 2001. In late 2001, unreleased tracks from
        the Toxicity sessions made their way onto the internet.[13] This
        collection of tracks was dubbed Toxicity II by fans. The group released
        a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently
        released the final versions of the songs as their third album, Steal
        This Album!, which was released in November 2002. Steal This Album!
        resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. About
        50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also
        released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of
        the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman's counter-culture book, Steal
        This Book as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the

        internet. The song "Innervision" was released as a promo single and
        received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for "Boom!" was
        filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in
        Iraq.

        On November 29, 2010, following several weeks of Internet rumors, System
        of a Down officially announced that they would be reuniting for a string
        of large European festival dates in June 2011.[22] Among the announced
        tour dates included UK's Download Festival, Switzerland's Greenfield
        Festival, Germany's Rock am Ring/Rock im Park, Sweden's Metaltown,
        Austria's Nova Rock Festival and Finland's Provinssirock. The reunion
        tour commenced on May 10, 2011 in Edmonton, Alberta.[23] System's first
        tour through Mexico and South America began on September 28, 2011 in
        Mexico City, ending in Santiago (Chile) on October 7, 2011.[24] From
        late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at
        Soundwave festival.[25] This was the band's first visit to Australia
        since 2005. The band have continued playing around the world. On August
        11 and 12, 2012, they played the Heavy MTL and Heavy T.O. music
        festivals in Montreal and Toronto respectively.[26] In August 2013
        System of a Down played at the UK's Reading and Leeds Festivals, among
        other festivals and venues that year.[27] System of a Down played their
        only 2013 US performance at the Hollywood Bowl on July 29; tickets sold
        out hours after going on sale on March 22. On November 23, 2014, System
        of a Down announced the Wake Up The Souls Tour to commemorate the 100th
        anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. The tour included a free concert
        in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia on April 23, 2015, their first
        show in the country.[28]
